# Deep-Learning-for-Dermatophyte-Fungi-Identification-
ðŸ§ª Project Title:
Deep Learning for Dermatophyte Fungi Identification

ðŸ“Œ Objective:
To develop an intelligent image-based classification system using deep learning models to detect and identify dermatophyte fungi from microscopic images for early and accurate diagnosis.

ðŸ§  Technology Stack:
Languages: Python

Libraries/Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Model: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Dataset: Dermatophyte fungal images (custom/labeled medical dataset)

Platform: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

ðŸ”¬ Key Contributions:
Collected and preprocessed a dataset of microscopic images of dermatophyte fungi.

Applied data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.

Built a CNN model for multi-class classification of common dermatophyte species.

âœ… Outcome:
The model successfully identifies different species of dermatophytes with promising accuracy, offering a cost-effective diagnostic aid.

Contributes to faster diagnosis and treatment, especially in under-resourced medical se

Achieved high accuracy in testing, demonstrating potential for clinical screening support.

Evaluated the model using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
